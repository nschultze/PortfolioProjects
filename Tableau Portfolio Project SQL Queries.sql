--Queries used for Tableau Project
-- 1. Global COVID-19 Death Rate Analysis
--Calculates the total cases, total deaths, and overall death percentage worldwide (excluding null continents). It provides a high-level view of COVID-19's global impact by calculating the mortality rate across all recorded cases.
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--Where location like '%states%'
where continent is not null 
--Group By date
order by 1,2

-- Just a double check based off the data provided
-- numbers are extremely close so we will keep them - The Second includes "International"  Location

order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- 4. Time-Series Analysis of Population Infection Rates
--Provides a temporal view of infection rates by country, showing how the percentage of infected population changed over time. It helps track the progression of COVID-19's spread across different countries throughout the pandemic.
Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths

order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- Queries I originally had, but excluded some because it created too long of video
-- Here only in case you want to check them out
-- 1. Vaccination Tracking by Location
--Shows continent, location, date, population, and tracks total vaccinations over time. A basic vaccination progress tracker without percentage calculations.
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population
, MAX(vac.total_vaccinations) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
--, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100

group by dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population
order by 1,2,3


-- 2. Global COVID-19 Mortality Overview
--Calculates total cases, deaths, and death percentage worldwide. Very similar to one of the used queries but structured slightly differently.
